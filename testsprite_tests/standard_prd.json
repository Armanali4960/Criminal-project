    "Enable citizens to upload images and receive real-time criminal detection feedback.",
    "Provide police officers with comprehensive dashboards to view and analyze detection reports and statistics.",
    "Ensure secure authentication and user management for citizens and police officers.",
    "Implement efficient face detection and matching using OpenCV for accurate criminal identification.",
    "Maintain a scalable and responsive web application that works across devices."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Citizen Dashboard for image uploads, real-time face detection, matching, and instant alerts.",
    "Police Dashboard to access detailed detection reports, monitor criminals, and view analytics.",
    "User registration, login, and authentication system for both citizens and police officers.",
    "Criminal database management to store information and images of known criminals.",

    "If a match is found, an instant alert and detection report is generated and saved.",
    "Police log into the police dashboard to view all detection reports and monitor criminal activity.",
    "Police can access detailed information of each report including images and detection confidence.",
    "System authenticates users appropriately and maintains session integrity during usage."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Successful image upload and processing with OpenCV face detection.",
    "Accuracy of criminal matching against the stored criminal database.",
    "User authentication and authorization mechanisms for both citizens and police officers.",
    "Visualization and correctness of detection reports on police dashboard.",
    "Responsiveness of the application across device types and browsers.",
    "No critical errors or crashes during typical user interactions.",
